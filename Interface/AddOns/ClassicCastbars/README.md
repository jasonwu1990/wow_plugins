## Install
- Install as any other addon, but make sure that the addon folder is **called just "ClassicCastbars", not "ClassicCastbars-master" or "ClassicCastbars-v1.0.0".**
- You can also download from WoWInterface instead of Github [here.](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info24925-ClassicCastbars.html)

## Configuration
You may configure this addon using chat commands:
- `/castbar target enable` - Toggles castbar for Target Frame. You might need to retarget an unit for it to update.
- `/castbar nameplate enable` - Toggles castbar for Nameplates.
- `/castbar target pos dynamic` - Toggles automatic positioning for Target castbar. Default on.
- `/castbar target pos xValue yValue` - Set X and Y offset position for Target castbar.
  Negative X value will move bar left, positive right. Y value is same thing but moves up and down.
  Using this will automatically disable dynamic positioning.
  Replace xValue and yValue with your values, for example:
  `/castbar target pos 20 -40`
- `/castbar nameplate pos xValue yValue` - Same as above but for nameplate castbars.
